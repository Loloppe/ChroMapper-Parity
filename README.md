# Parity
Tag and visualize your Beat Saber map parity  
## How to use
Most of this plugin is automated. Simply load the map and the notes colors will changes.  
- Forehand : Default color
- Backhand : Slightly darker color

The colors change when placing notes, moving the grid, etc.  
You can select notes and then press F1 to swap the parity and enforce it.  
To undo this, select notes, press and hold F1 for one second.  
Enforced parity notes are saved in parity.txt in your map folder whenever you save your map.  
That file is loaded automatically on map load.
